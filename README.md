Express Based API of a Dataset of Marvel Cinematic Universe Characters

Downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/apriandito/mcu-characters
Kaggle's MCU Characters CSV from : https://www.kaggle.com/apriandito/mcu-characters and it's from an original dataset from Kamis Data Program - R Indonesia: https://github.com/indo-r/kamisdata). All characters are owned and copywrite by Marvel.

I utilized a CSV to JSON converter (https://csvjson.com/csv2json) to convert out a JSON from the CSV dataset.
